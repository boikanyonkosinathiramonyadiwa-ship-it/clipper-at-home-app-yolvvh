Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen displaying available services (haircuts, beard trims, etc.), a brief introduction to your barber service, and perhaps a featured barber or special offer.\n-   **Booking Screen:** A screen where users can select a service, choose a barber (if you have multiple), pick a date and time, and enter their address.\n-   **Profile Screen:** A screen where users can manage their profile information, view upcoming appointments, and see their appointment history.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f7f3` (Off-White)\n    *   Text: `#343a40` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6c757d` (Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#007bff` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#6c757d` (Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#ffc107` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#17a2b8` (Cyan)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a professional look.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen:**\n    *   Read `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to understand the current structure of the home screen.\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to include sections for:\n        *   Available services (e.g., \"Haircut\", \"Beard Trim\", \"Shave\"). These can be simple `Pressable` components with icons and text.\n        *   A brief \"About Us\" section.\n        *   A \"Featured Barber\" section (can be a placeholder for now).\n    *   Update the styling in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to use the specified colors and typography.\n\n2.  **Create a Booking Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file `app/booking.tsx`.\n    *   In `app/booking.tsx`, create a basic form with the following fields:\n        *   Service selection (dropdown or radio buttons).\n        *   Barber selection (if applicable).\n        *   Date and time selection (using a date/time picker component).\n        *   Address input field.\n        *   A \"Book Appointment\" button.\n    *   Style the booking screen using the specified colors and typography.\n\n3.  **Modify the Profile Screen:**\n    *   Read `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` to understand the current structure of the profile screen.\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` to include sections for:\n        *   User profile information (name, contact details).\n        *   Upcoming appointments (can be a placeholder for now).\n        *   Appointment history (can be a placeholder for now).\n    *   Update the styling in `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` to use the specified colors and typography.\n\n4.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Ensure that the tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` includes a tab for the booking screen.\n    *   Make sure the tabs navigate to the correct screens.\n\n5.  **Remove modalDemos:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not needed for the barber app.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-03T16:32:19.575348"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a house call barber service app!
